# parallel-program-with-CUDA

The purpose of this activity is to study programming for GPUs. Therefore, an implementation of the matrix multiplication program using CUDA was carried out.

In addition to implementing and verifying the correctness of the results generated by the parallelized version of the program, different ways of partitioning thead blocks and their effects on the program's execution times were investigated.
